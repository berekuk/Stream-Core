API is important, and so are terms

Find better names:
- for top namespace (Stream is too general and long)
- for Storage (Pool? Tank, Reservoir, Cistern? Store?)

Implement some common streams:
- in
    stdin
- out
    stdout
    dump
- filter
    line2str
    str2line
    freeze
    thaw
    debug_dump # this differs from out:dump in that it isn't last element of stream... or does it really matters?
    eval
