API is important, and so are terms

Implement some common streams:
- in
    stdin
- out
    stdout
    dump
- filter
    line2str
    str2line
    freeze
    thaw
    debug_dump # this differs from out:dump in that it isn't last element of stream... or does it really matters?
    eval

Formatters (hashref <=> string):
 - Data::Dumper
 - Storable
 - JSON
 - XML
